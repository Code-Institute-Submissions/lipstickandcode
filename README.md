# Hello World!
Welcome to my first front end web page.
Please note that I followed the learning path on the old Learning Portal (LMS). 
This is the Stream 1 project - Front End only.

## Project: "Lipstick & Code"

This page is to inform and encourage women of all ages to code.

Visit my website [here](https://coffeeipsum.github.io/lipstickandcode/)

## Technologies Used
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [Bootstrap 4.1.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Bootstrap Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/carousel/)


## Testing 
- Manual only

## Testing Procedure

### Manual Testing
- Try and click on each Nav Bar item
- Click on Logo (this should redirect the user to "Home")
- Contact > Drop-down: select each items
- Social icons in Footer>> test redirect (open new tab)
- on Role Models: try and click the 'next' and previous buttons on Carousel


## Known Limitations/Issues 
- in Stream 1 we did not learn how to wire a Contact form to a server. This means 
- that the 'submit' button on the Contact form won't work. That's expected.



**Thank you for visiting my site!**
